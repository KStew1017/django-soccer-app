For this portfolio project I am going to create a web-based application to show information about soccer matches being played in the UEFA Champions League, such as teams playing, matchups, event information, scores, and more. I am hoping to make the application feature-rich and display as much information as possible, maybe even with a simple front-end UI, time permitting. The goal will be to emulate ESPN’s system for displaying match information, although not as in-depth.

The REST API endpoints I would like to implement will be the basic CRUD operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting information from the database about the soccer matches. Some examples would be to create a PATCH endpoint for match scores, create a GET endpoint for team rosters, etc. These will likely be formatted as request bodies in JSON.
The database itself will be normalized to reduce data redundancy by separating certain information into separate tables, such as teams, team rosters, match/venue information, and match scores.

Matches:

·         Match ID (serial) (primary key)
·         Date (smalldatetime) (non-nullable)
·         Home team (text) (non-nullable)
·         Away team (text) (non-nullable)
